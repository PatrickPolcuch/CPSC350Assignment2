The game of life

Used StackOverflow to figure out how to dynamically allocate memory for a 2d array: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/936687/how-do-i-declare-a-2d-array-in-c-using-new
It seems like this is a common way to do it, but it some people were saying it is garbage.

Had to look up why I couldn't declare a function as static in the class and should only declare it is static in the .h file.
